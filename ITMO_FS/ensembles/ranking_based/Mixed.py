    this way:
        Get ranks from every filter from input.
        Then loops through, on every iteration=i
            selects features on i position on every filter
            then shuffles them, then adds to result list without

    Parameters
    ----------
    filters : collection
        Collection of measure functions with signature measure(X, y) that
        should return an array of importance values for each feature.
    n_features : int
        Amount of features to select.
    fusion_function : callable
        A function with signature (filter_ranks (array-like, shape
        (n_filters, n_features), k (int)) that should return the indices of k
        selected features based on the filter rankings.

class UnivariateFilter(BaseTransformer):
    """Basic interface for using univariate measures for feature selection.
    List of available measures is in ITMO_FS.filters.univariate.measures, also
    you can provide your own measure, but it should suit the argument scheme
    for measures, i.e. take two arguments x,y and return scores for all the
    features in dataset x. Same applies to cutting rules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    measure : string or callable
        A metric name defined in GLOB_MEASURE or a callable with signature
        measure (sample dataset, labels of dataset samples) which should
        return a list of metric values for each feature in the dataset.
    cutting_rule : string or callables
        A cutting rule name defined in GLOB_CR or a callable with signature
        cutting_rule (features) which should return a list of features ranked
        by some rule.

class UnivariateFilter(TransformerMixin):  # TODO ADD LOGGING
    """
        Basic interface for using univariate measures for feature selection.
        List of available measures is in ITMO_FS.filters.univariate.measures, also you can
        provide your own measure but it should suit the argument scheme for measures,
        i.e. take two arguments x,y and return scores for all the features in dataset x.
        Same applies to cutting rules.

        Parameters
        ----------
        measure : string or callable
            A metric name defined in GLOB_MEASURE or a callable with signature
            measure (sample dataset, labels of dataset samples)
            which should return a list of metric values for each feature in the dataset.
        cutting_rule : string or callables
            A cutting rule name defined in GLOB_CR or a callable with signature
            cutting_rule (features),
            which should return a list features ranked by some rule.
